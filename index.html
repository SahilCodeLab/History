    <div class="question">
        <div class="question-title">Q4. Describe the contributions of the Pallavas to art and architecture.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>The Pallavas ruled parts of South India from the 6th to the 9th century CE, mainly in present-day Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. They were great patrons of art and architecture, and their rule marked a transition from rock-cut to structural temples in Indian architecture. Their capital city, Kanchipuram, became a major cultural and architectural center.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">1. Rock-Cut Architecture:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>The earliest Pallava architecture consisted of monolithic rock-cut temples.</li>
                <li>These were created during the reign of Mahendravarman I and Narasimhavarman I.</li>
                <li>Mahabalipuram (Mamallapuram) is the best example of this phase.</li>
                <li>Important examples include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Five Rathas (Pancha Rathas): Each ratha is carved from a single rock.</li>
                        <li>Cave Temples: Varaha Cave, Mahishasuramardini Cave, and others show mythological scenes and fine carvings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="section-title">2. Structural Temples:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Pallavas were among the first to build free-standing stone temples in South India.</li>
                <li>These temples mark the beginning of the Dravidian style of architecture.</li>
                <li>Notable examples include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shore Temple (Mahabalipuram): A complex built of granite blocks with two shrines.</li>
                        <li>Kailasanatha Temple (Kanchipuram): Built by Rajasimha Pallava, this is the oldest structural temple in Tamil Nadu with intricate sculptures and a pyramidal tower.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="section-title">3. Sculpture and Carving:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Pallava sculptures are known for grace, fluidity, and fine detailing.</li>
                <li>Figures of gods, animals, and humans are carved with realism and expression.</li>
                <li>Most sculptures depicted Hindu mythology, especially Shaivism.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="section-title">4. Paintings:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Though few Pallava paintings survive, references suggest that temples were decorated with murals.</li>
                <li>Some painting remains have been found in temples in Kanchipuram.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="section-title">5. Influence on Southeast Asia:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Pallava architectural styles and scripts spread to countries like Cambodia, Thailand, and Indonesia.</li>
                <li>The Pallava Grantha script was the basis for many Southeast Asian scripts.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="section-title">6. Patronage of Learning and Culture:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Temples were not just places of worship but also centers of learning, music, and dance.</li>
                <li>Kanchipuram attracted scholars, poets, and artists from all over.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="conclusion">
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Pallavas laid the foundation for South Indian temple architecture. Their innovations in both rock-cut and structural temples set the stage for later dynasties like the Cholas and Vijayanagara Empire. The art and architecture developed during the Pallava period left a lasting legacy on Indian and Southeast Asian culture.
